This group project program creates a class registration system.
It allows students to add courses, drop courses and list courses they are registered for and it provides waitlist funcitonality. It also allows students to review the tuition costs for their course roster and view financial aid benefits. 
My contributions to this project include the control loop in the registration module, and the student module in full. Ed, Jackie and I had a great time working on this, thank you for looking it over!
